## KOSMOS Learning Path

The KOSMOS Systems Auditor is an integrated approach that combines four revolutionary frameworks that work together through a mathematically validated sequence, which lays the foundation for a KOSMOS practioner's pathway to learning the KOSMOS Framework:

The 7ES Framework: Provides the structural foundation—recursive, fractal analysis that reveals how systems work across 61+ orders of magnitude

The Fundamental Design Principles (FDPs): Evaluates whether systems align with nature’s 3.8 billion years of evolutionary intelligence using the structural foundation from 7ES analysis

The Designer Query Discriminator (DQD): Classifies where systems come from—natural emergence versus artificial design—using the FDP violations as diagnostic evidence

The Observer’s Collapse Function (OCF): Predicts system persistence by analyzing neurobiologically-grounded belief dependence, informed by the classification from DQD analysis

This sequence matters enormously because starting with structure prevents analytical bias. One can’t accurately score “Distributed Agency” without first mapping where decisions actually get made. And one can’t predict collapse probability without first understanding whether problems stem from artificial design choices versus natural adaptation challenges.
